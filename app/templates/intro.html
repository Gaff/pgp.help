    <ul>
      <li>PGP allows you to send encrypted messages. Encrypted messages can only be read by the recipient and no-one else.</li>
      <li>To send a message you need the recipient&#8217;s <b>public key</b>. You will have to ask them to give you this.</li>
      <li>To receive messages you need a <b>private key</b>. We can generate one for you.</i>
