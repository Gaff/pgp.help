###Help, what is PGP? How do I use this?

Chances are you were sent here by someone who wants you to send them an encrypted message. This is what you need to do:

* Paste their public key into the public key box.
* Type your message to them in the message box.
* Copy the encrypted message from the result box and send it back to them.

###Is this site safe? Is my data private?

All the code runs locally in your browser. No data is sent over the network. Therefore it should be safe to use. However there are some risks which I'll note below:

**This website is loaded over the internet.** This means that it's possible that a malicious actor (or even the author) subverts the code on this page before it gets to you and makes it share your data. Make sure you load this page from:>https://pgp.help, and if you're really paranoid save a known good copy locally and only run that (see .zip link in the footer).

**The code runs in a browser.** This means that if your browser is compromised it may be possible to make it leak data from other tabs / sites. If you're worried then it would be prudent to do your PGP work in a separate session to other browsing, or restart your browser before you do any sensitive PGP work.

###Can I help with your project? Can you help with my project?

I'd love any help! Feel free to contact me, or just send me pull requests. Whatever makes you happy. I'm especially interested if you spot any secruity issues. I'm also looking for someone who can help me make my html / css look prettier. I am willing to pay for certain things (via Bitcoin), so please get in touch.

I'm currently looking for work in the security space. If you are interested or thing I could help please get in touch. If you would like specific enhancements added to the site then please feel free to ask.

###How can I contact you? What is your PGP key?

You can email me at hello@pgp.help
