##FAQ

###Help, what is PGP? How do I use this?

Chances are you were sent here by someone who wants you to send them an encrypted message. This is what you need to do:

* Paste their public key into the public key box.
* Type your message to them in the message box.
* Copy the encrypted message from the result box and send it back to them.

###Is this site safe? Is my data private?

All the code runs locally in your browser. No data is sent over the network. Therefore it should be safe to use. However there are some risks which I'll note below:

''This website is loaded over the internet.'' This means that it's possible that a malicious actor (or even the author) subverts the code on this page before it gets to you and makes it share your data. Make sure you load this page from:>https://pgp.help, and if you're really paranoid save a known good copy locally and only run that (see .zip link in the footer).<

''The code runs in a browser.'' This means that if your browser is compromised it may be possible to make it leak data from other tabs / sites. If you're worried then it would be prudent to do your PGP work in a separate session to other browsing, or restart your browser before you do any sensitive PGP work.</p>
